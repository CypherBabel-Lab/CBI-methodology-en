# Market Capitalization Weighted Indices

A majority of CBI’s crypto asset indices are market capitalization weighted and circulating-adjusted, where each crypto asset’s weight in the index is proportional to its total market value of its circulating supply. This is analogous to the free-float capitalization in the stock market.

CBI also provides capped versions of a market capitalization weighted index where single index constituents or defined groups of index constituents, such as sector or group, are confined to a maximum weight.

## Market Capitalization Weighted Index

Many of CBI’s indices are market capitalization weighted indices. Sometimes these are called value weighted, or market cap weighted, instead of market capitalization weighted. Examples include the CI 500, the S\&P Global 1200 and the S\&P BMI indices.
