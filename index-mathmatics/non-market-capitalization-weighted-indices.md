# Non-Market Capitalization Weighted Indices

A non-market capitalization weighted index (also referred to as a non-market cap or modified market cap index) is one where the weights of the index constituents are not determined by the market capitalization weighted methodology. For example, the weights are user-defined. Between index rebalancing, most corporate actions generally don't affect index weights, as they are fixed.
