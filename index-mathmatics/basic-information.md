# Basic Information

This document chapter covers the mathematics that CBI adopted to calculate various crypto asset indices and assumes some acquaintance with mathematical notation and simple operations. The calculations are presented principally as equations, which have largely been excluded from the individual index methodologies, with examples or tables of results to demonstrate the calculations.

CBI's index calculation varies according to the categorization of the indices.&#x20;

At a broad level, indices are divided into market capitalization weighted and **Non-Market Capitalization Weighted** Indices.
