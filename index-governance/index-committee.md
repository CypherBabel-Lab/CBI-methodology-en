# Index Committee

The CBI indices are maintained by an Index Committee. The Index Committee is responsible for the governance and maintenance of the CBI indices, including modifying the eligibility criteria, changing the index calculation methodologies, adjusting the index constituents' weight, and relevant vital issues. The Index Committee is also responsible for explaining unexpected situations of the CBI indices.&#x20;

The committee meets regularly. At each meeting, the Index Committee may review pending corporate actions that may affect index constituents, statistics comparing the composition of the indices to the market, companies that are being considered as candidates for addition to an index, and any significant market events. In addition, the Index Committee may revise the index policy covering rules for selecting companies, calculation methodologies, or other matters.&#x20;

CBI considers information about changes to its indices and related matters to be potentially market-moving material. Therefore, all Index Committee discussions are confidential.CBI Index Committees reserve the right to make exceptions when applying the methodology if the need arises. In any scenario where the treatment differs from the general rules stated in this document or supplemental documents, clients will receive sufficient notice, whenever possible.&#x20;

In addition to the daily governance of indices and maintenance of index methodologies, at least once within any 12-month period, the Index Committee reviews the methodology to ensure the indices continue to achieve the stated objectives, and that the data and methodology remain effective. CBI may publish a consultation inviting comments from external parties in certain instances.
