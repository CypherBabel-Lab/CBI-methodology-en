# Additions

The additions of index constituents are categorized into two types: the **index with a constant number of constituents** and the **index with a non-constant number of constituents**.

* Index with a constant number of constituents: an addition correlates to a deletion. A constituent must be deleted when another constituent is added to keep the number of constituents constant.
* Index with a non-constant number of constituents: an addition does not correlate to a deletion.

## Regular Rules

When the deletion is planned for an index with a constant number of constituents, a corresponding addition must be executed.

## Other Rules

When a significant situation or an emergency happens, the proposal for addition can be made by the Index Committee. The addition must be completed within 24 hours.
