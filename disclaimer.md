All information provided by CypherBabel is impersonal and not tailored to the needs of any person, entity, or group of persons. Any returns or performance provided within are for illustrative purposes only and do not demonstrate actual performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future investment results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Exposure to an asset class is available through investable instruments based on an index. CypherBabel and its affiliates do not sponsor, endorse, sell, promote or manage any investment fund or other vehicle that is offered by third parties and that seeks to provide an investment return based on the returns of any CypherBabel index. There is no assurance that investment products based on the index will accurately track index performance or provide positive investment returns. CypherBabel is not an investment advisor, and CypherBabel and its affiliates make no representation regarding the advisability of investing in any such investment fund or other vehicles. A decision to invest in any such investment fund or other vehicles should not be made in reliance on any of the statements set forth in this document. Prospective investors are advised to make an investment in any such fund or other vehicles only after carefully considering the risks associated with investing in such funds, as detailed in an offering memorandum or similar document that is prepared by or on behalf of the issuer of the investment fund or other vehicle. The inclusion of a security within an index is not a recommendation by CypherBabel or its affiliates to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice.
