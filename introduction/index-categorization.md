# Index Categorization

CBI indices are generally categorized into **Market Capitalization Weighted** and **Non-market Capitalization Weighted Indices**.

Most CBI indices are market capitalization weighted and circulating-adjusted, where each constituent's weight in the index is proportional to its circulating-adjusted market value. CBI also provides capped market capitalization weighted index where single index constituents or defined groups of index constituents, such as sector or theme groups, are confined to a maximum weight.

Non-market capitalization weighted indices include those not weighted by circulating-adjusted market capitalization and generally are not affected by notional market capitalization changes resulting from corporate events, such as indices that apply equal weighting or other alternative weighting schemes.
