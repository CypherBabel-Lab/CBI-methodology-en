# Index Categorization

The CBI indices are generally defined into two categorizations: **Market Capitalization Weighted** and **Non-market Capitalization Weighted Indices**.

Most of CBI indices are market capitalization weighted and circulating-adjusted, where each constituent's weight in the index is proportional to its circulating-adjusted market value.
