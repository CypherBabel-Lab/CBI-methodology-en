# Index Categorization

CBI indices are generally defined into two categorizations: **Market Capitalization Weighted** and **Non-market Capitalization Weighted Indices**.

Most of CBI indices are market capitalization weighted and circulating-adjusted, where each constituent's weight in the index is proportional to its circulating-adjusted market value. CBI also provides capped versions of a market capitalization weighted index where single index constituents or defined groups of index constituents, such as sector or geographical groups, are confined to a maximum weight.
